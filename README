INFORMATION ABOUT DHCP CODE
----------------------------------

For implementing DHCP we have added 3 classes in model of internet (client, server and header)
and a helper class in same module.

Two test examples have been included in the scratch folder dhcp-test.cc and dhcp-test1.cc
These can be executed using waf

./waf --run scratch/dhcp-test
./waf --run scratch/dhcp-test1
